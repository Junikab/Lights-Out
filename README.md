Lights Out Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Lights Out" using React.

# Game Description
The game consists of a grid of cells that are either lit or unlit. 
Clicking on a cell toggles the cell's state as well as the state of its adjacent cells (above, below, left, and right). 
The goal of the game is to turn off all the lights on the board.
